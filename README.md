# VirusTotal
<b>This is a repo consisting of 4 Python scripts that were done to filter malicious IOCs'. In here, we can filter any IOCs, such as,<b>

<ul>
<li>File Hashes</li>
<li>
  IP addresses
</li>
<li>
  Domains
</li>
<li>
  URLs
</li>
</ul>

For the filtering part, we used Virustotal (API Key), which is a website created by the Spanish security company Hispasec Sistemas. Google acquired it in September 2012, following its launch in June 2004. The company's ownership switched in January 2018 to Chronicle, a subsidiary of Google. VirusTotal aggregates many antivirus products and online scan engines called Contributors.
